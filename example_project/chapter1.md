# Chapter 1: Stalkwood

## Intro

The players have just started their adventure!
They are in the outskirts of the town named Stalkwood.
Stalkwood sits nestled in a small valley between two great mountain peaks, Ier to the east and Rej to the west.
The players were brought here via a caravan in hopes to find work they each may have their own motives but fate has brought them together to seek out fame and glory in the mountains.
> You stand in front of a large, fortified, wooden gate that spans between the beginnings of two large peaks. A dirt road in front of you leads through the gate to the interior of a town. You see two guards standing in front of the gate, but people seem to pass freely in and out some carrying goods, others carrying weapons.
